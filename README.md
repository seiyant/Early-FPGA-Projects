**P1 Combinational Logic and State Machine Design Using Verilog**

p1_top.v and p1_top_tb.v

A password set lock operation using a Mealy state machine connected with a 7-segment LED display on the DE1-SoC using a combinational logic block. 

**P2 ARM Assembly Programming**

p2_top.s

Implements a binary search algorithm in ARM assembly to locate a key within an array, making use of stack operations and ARM instructions to manage function parameters, intermediate values, and control flow.
