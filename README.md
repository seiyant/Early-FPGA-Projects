**P1 Combinational Logic and State Machine Design**

p1_top.v

*p1_top_tb.v*

A password set lock operation using a Mealy state machine connected with a 7-segment LED display on the DE1-SoC using a combinational logic block. 

**P2 ARM Assembly Programming**

p2_top.s

Implements a binary search algorithm in ARM assembly to locate a key within an array, making use of stack operations and ARM instructions.

**P3 Datapath for the Simple RISC Machine**
p3_top.v, p3_datapath.v, p3_alu.v, p3_regfile.v, p3_shifter.v

*p3_datapath_tb.v, p3_alu_tb.v, p3_regfile_tb.v, p3_shifter_tb.v*

Implements a datapath for a simple RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) machine, integrating register file, ALU, and shifter modules to execute basic arithmetic and logical operations, with a status register to record special outcomes like zero results.

**P4 Finite State Machine Controller for the Simple RISC Machine**

**P5 Adding Memory and IO to the Simple RISC Machine**

**P6 Supporting Branches in the Simple RISC Machine**
